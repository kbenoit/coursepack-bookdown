# Computer classes {#c-class0}

\setcounter{section}{-1}

Some general instructions on computing and the SPSS package are given
first below. It makes most sense to read these together with the
instructions for individual computer classes, which begin in Section \@ref(p-class1).

## General instructions

#### Using the networked computers at LSE {-}

-   To access IT facilities at LSE you need an IT account with its
    **Username** and **Password**. Please see
    ` http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/IMT/`\
    `guides/accounts/activateAccount.aspx` for instructions on how to
    activate your account. In case of any problems, please ask for
    assistance at the IT help desk (Library 1st floor).

-   Various introductory **documents** can be accessed through the IMT
    services web pages at
    `http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/IMT/home.aspx`.

-   **Logging in** to use Windows: When you arrive at a networked
    computer, wait for Windows to start up (if the machine is not
    already on). Type in **CTRL + ALT + Delete** and the **Enter Network
    Password** screen will appear. Type in your username and your
    password and press **Enter** or click on the **OK** button. This
    will log you on to the computer.

#### Data downloading {-}

The instructions for each class will give the name of a file or files
which will be used for that exercise. In order to do the class, you will
need to download the file to your H: space (i.e. your personal file
storage space on the LSE network, shown as disk drive H: on a networked
computer once you have logged on). You can download all the data files
for the course, as well as other course-related material, from the
web-based **Moodle** system. See instructions in Chapter \@ref(c-course-information) for how to register for MY451 on Moodle.

## Introduction to SPSS {#s-intro-SPSS}

#### General information and documentation {-}

SPSS (formerly Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) is a widely
used general-purpose statistical software package. It will be used for
all the computer classes on this course. The current version on the LSE
network is SPSS 21. This section gives some general information on the
structure and use of SPSS. The discussion is brief and not meant to be
comprehensive. The instructions given here and in the descriptions of
individual computer classes below will be sufficient for the purposes of
this course. If, however, you wish to find out more about SPSS, more
information and examples can be found in the SPSS help files and
tutorials found under the **Help** menu of the program, and in
introductory guide books such as

Field, A. (2013). *Discovering Statistics using IBM SPSS Statistics*
(4th ed). Sage.
Kinnear, P. R. and Gray, C. D. (2012). *SPSS 19 Made Simple*. Psychology
Press.
Pallant, J. (2013). *SPSS Survival Manual* (5th ed). Open University
Press.

These are given here purely as examples (there are many others) and not
as recommendations. We have not reviewed any of these books in detail
and so cannot make any comparisons between them.

#### Starting SPSS {-}

To start SPSS, double-click on the SPSS icon on the Windows desktop.
Alternatively, click on the **Start** button at the bottom left corner,
and select **All Programs**, then **Specialist and teaching software**,
**Statistics**, **SPSS**, and finally **SPSS 21** (or some obvious
variant of these, in case the exact wording on your desktop is slightly
different).

An initial screen for opening data files appears. Click on **Cancel** to
get rid of this and to enter the data editor (which will be discussed
further below).

#### Exiting from SPSS {-}

Select **Exit** from the **File** menu or click on the X at the upper
right corner of the SPSS data editor window. You may then be prompted to
save the information in the open windows; in particular, you should save
the contents of the data editor in a file (see below) if you have made
any changes to it.

#### SPSS windows {-}

There are several different types of windows in SPSS. The two most
important are

-   **Data editor**: A data set is displayed in the Data Editor window.
    Several of these can be open at a time. The data editor which you
    have selected (clicked on) most recently defines the active data
    set, and the procedures you request from the menus are applied to
    this data set until you select a different active data set. The data
    editor window has two parts, accessed by clicking on the two tabs at
    the bottom of the window:

    -   **Data view**, which shows the data matrix in the
        spreadsheet-like form discussed in Section
        \@ref(ss-intro-def-subj), with units in the rows and variables in
        the columns.

    -   **Variable view**, which shows information about the variables.

    Working with the data editor will be practised in the first
    computer class. The contents of the data editor, i.e.the data matrix
    and associated information, can be saved in an SPSS data file. Such
    files have names with the extension **.sav**.

-   **Output viewer**: Output from statistical analyses carried out on
    the data will appear here. The output can be printed directly from
    the viewer or copied and pasted to other programs. The contents of
    the viewer can also be saved in a file, with a name with the
    extension **.spv** (since version 17; in previous versions of SPSS
    the extension was **.spo**).

There are also other windows, for example for editing SPSS graphs. They
will be discussed in the instructions to individual computer classes
where necessary.

#### Menus {-}

SPSS has a menu-based interface, which can be used to access most of its
features for statistical analysis, manipulation of data, loading, saving
and printing files, and so on.

-   The procedures for statistical analysis are found under the
    **Analyze** menu, which provides further drop-down menus for
    choosing different methods.

    -   Similarly, procedures for various statistical graphics are found
        under **Graphs**. We will be using procedures found under
        **Graphs / Legacy Dialogs**. Here “legacy” means that these are
        the graphics menus which were included also in previous versions
        of SPSS. The current version also contains a second, new set of
        menus for the same graphs, under **Graphs / Chart Builder**. We
        do not regard these as an improvement in usability, so we will
        continue to use the old menus. You are welcome to explore the
        cababilities of the “Chart Builder” on your own.

-   Eventually the menu choices lead to a **dialog box** with various
    boxes and buttons for specifying details of the required analysis.
    Most dialog boxes contain buttons which open new dialog boxes for
    further options. The details of these choices for the methods
    covered on this course are described in the instructions to
    individual computer classes.

-   Almost all of the dialog boxes have options which are not needed for
    our classes and never mentioned in the instructions. Some of these
    simply modify the output, others request variants of the statistical
    methods which will not be used in these classes. All such options
    have default values which can be left untouched here. You are,
    however, welcome to experiment with these additional choices to see
    what they do. Further information on them can be accessed through
    the **Help** button in each dialog box.

#### Notational conventions for the instructions {-}

Because analyses in SPSS are carried out by making choices from the
menus, the instructions for the computer classes need to describe these
choices somehow. To reduce the length and tedium of the instructions, we
will throughout present them in a particular format explained below.
Because this information is rather abstract if read in isolation, it is
best to go through it while carrying out specific instructions for the
first few computer classes.

-   The appropriate menu choices for obtaining the dialog box for the
    required analysis are first given in bold, for example as follows:

    **Analyze/Descriptive statistics/Frequencies**

    This is short for “Click on the menu item **Analyze** at the top of
    the window; from the drop-down menu, select **Descriptive
    statistics** and then click on **Frequencies**.” This particular
    choice opens a dialog box for constructing various descriptive
    statistics and graphs (as discussed in Chapter \@ref(c-descr1)).

    Unless otherwise mentioned, subsequent instructions then refer to
    choices in the most recently opened dialog box, without repeating
    the full path to it.

-   For all of the statistical analyses, we need first to specify which
    variables the analyses should be applied to. This is done by
    entering the names of those variables in appropriate boxes in the
    dialog boxes. For example, the dialog box opened above has a box
    labelled **Variable(s)** for this purpose. The dialog box also
    includes a separate box containing a list of all the variables in
    the data set. The required variables are selected from this list and
    moved to the choice boxes (and back again, when choices are changed)
    by clicking on an arrow button between the boxes. For example,
    suppose that a data set contains a grouped age variable called
    *AGEGROUP*, for which we want to construct a frequency table. The
    class instructions may then state in words “Place *AGEGROUP* in the
    **Variable(s)** box”, or sometimes just

    **Variable(s)/***AGEGROUP*

    both of which are short for “In the dialog box opened above, click
    on the name *AGEGROUP* in the list of variables, and then click on
    the arrow button to move the name into the **Variable(s)** box”.
    Sometimes we may also use a generic instruction of the form

    **Variable(s)/***$<$Variables$>$*

    where *$<$Variables$>$* indicates that this is where we would put
    the name of any variables for which we want to obtain a
    frequency table. Note that here and in many other procedures, it is
    possible to select several variables at once. For the Frequencies
    procedure used as an example here, this simply means that a separate
    frequency table is constructed for each selected variable.

-   Other choices in a dialog box determine details of the analysis and
    its output. In most cases the selection is made from a fixed list of
    possibilities provided by SPSS, by clicking on the appropriate box
    or button. In the instructions, the choice is indicated by listing a
    path to it, for example as

    **Charts/Chart Type/Bar charts**

    in the above example (this requests the so-called bar chart). The
    items on such a list are labels for various items in the
    dialog boxes. For example, here **Charts** is a button which opens a
    new subsidiary dialog box, **Chart Type** is the title of a list of
    options in this new dialog box, and **Bar charts** is the choice we
    want to select. In other words, the above instruction is short for
    “In the dialog box opened above, click on the button **Charts** to
    open a new dialog box. Under **Chart type**, select **Bar charts**
    by clicking on a button next to it.”

-   Some choices need to be made by typing in some information rather
    than selecting from a list of options. Specific instructions for
    this will be given when needed.

-   After choices are made in subsidiary dialog boxes, we return to the
    main dialog box by clicking on **Continue**. Once all the required
    choices have been made, the analysis is executed by clicking on
    **OK** in the main dialog box. This should be reasonably obvious, so
    we will omit explicit instructions to do so.


A useful feature of SPSS is the **dialog recall** button, which is
typically sixth from the left in the top row of buttons in the Output
viewer window; the button shows a rectangle with a green arrow pointing
down from it. Clicking on this gives a menu of recently used procedures,
and choosing one of these brings up the relevant dialog box, with the
previously used choices selected. This is useful when you want to rerun
a procedure, e.g. to try different choices for its options. It is
usually quicker to reopen a dialog box using the dialog recall button
than through the menus.


#### SPSS session options {-}


Various options for controlling the format of SPSS output and other
features can be found under **Edit/Options**. For example, an often
useful choice is **General/Variable Lists/Display
names**. This instructs SPSS to display the names
of variables in the variable lists of all procedures, instead of the
(typically much longer) descriptive labels of the variables. In large
data sets this may make it easier to find the right variables from the
list. This may be further helped by selecting **General/Variable
Lists/Alphabetical**, which causes the names to be listed in an
alphabetical order rather than the order in which the variables are
included in the data set.


#### Printing from SPSS {-}


All the computers in the public rooms are connected to one of the laser
printers. When you print a document or a part of it, you need to have
credit on your printing account. See
\small{\texttt{http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/LSEServices/IMT/guides/printing.aspx}}
\normalsizefor further information.

-   You can print your results from the Output Viewer either by
    selecting **File/Print** or by clicking on Print on the toolbar (the
    button with a little picture of a printer). Please note that SPSS
    output is often quite long, so this may result in much more printout
    than you really want.

-   Alternatively, in the Output Viewer, select the objects to be
    printed, select **Edit / Copy**, open a Word or Excel document and
    **Paste**. You can make any changes or corrections in this document
    before printing it. This method gives you more control over what
    gets printed than printing directly from SPSS.

-   At the printer terminal, type in your username and password. The
    files sent for printing are then listed. Select the appropriate file
    number and follow the instructions given by the computer.

#### SPSS control language {-}

Early versions of SPSS had no menu-based interface. Instead, commands
were executed by specifying them in SPSS command language. This language
is still there, underlying the menus, and each choice of commands and
options from the menus can also be specified in the control language. We
will not use this approach on this course, so you can ignore this
section if you wish. However, there are some very good reasons why you
might want to learn about the control language if you need to work with
SPSS for, say, analyses for your thesis or dissertation:

-   Because the control language commands can be saved in a file, they
    preserve a record of how an analysis was done. This may be important
    for checking that there were no errors, and for rerunning the
    analyses later if needed.

-   For repetitive analyses, modifying and rerunning commands in the
    control language is quicker and less tedious than using the
    menus repeatedly.

-   Some advanced SPSS procedures are not included in the menus, and can
    only be accessed through the control language.

The main cost of using the control language is learning its syntax. This
is initially much harder than using the menus, but becomes easier with
experience. The easiest way to begin learning the syntax is to request
SPSS to print out the commands corresponding to choices made from the
menus. Two easy ways of doing so are

-   Selecting the session option (i.e. under **Edit/Options**)
    **Viewer/Display commands in the log**. This causes the commands
    corresponding to the menu choices to be displayed in the
    output window.

-   Clicking on the **Paste** button in a dialog box (instead of **OK**)
    after selecting an analysis. This opens a *Syntax window* where the
    corresponding commands are now displayed. The commands in a syntax
    window can be edited and executed, and also saved in a file (with
    the extension **.sps**) for future use.

## WEEK 2 class: Descriptive statistics for categorical data, and entering data {#p-class1}

#### Data set {-}

The data file **ESS5\_sample.sav** will be used today. It contains a
simplified sample of data from UK respondents in the 2010 European
Social Survey (Round 5). The questions in the survey that you see here
were designed By Dr Jonathan Jackson and his team as part of a module
investigating public trust in the criminal justice system. Further
information about the study can be found at\
`www.lse.ac.uk/methodology/whosWho/Jackson/jackson_ESS.aspx` [^1]

The main purpose of today’s class is to introduce you to the layout of
SPSS and to show you how to produce some basic tables and graphs for
categorical variables. Additionally, we provide instructions on how to
enter data into a new SPSS data file, using the Data Editor. This
exercise is not strictly needed for the course, but we include it for
two purposes. Firstly, students often find this a helpful way of
learning how the software works. Secondly, this exercise may be a useful
introduction for students who go on to collect or collate data for their
own empirical research.

#### Classwork {-}

#### Part 1: The layout of an SPSS data file {-}

1.  **Opening an SPSS data file**: this is done from **File/Open/Data**,
    selecting the required file from whichever folder it is saved in in
    the usual Windows way. Do this to open ESS5\_sample.sav.

2.  **Information in the Variable View window.** The data file is now
    displayed in the Data Editor. Its Data View window shows the data as
    a spreadsheet (i.e. a data matrix). We will first consider the
    information in the Variable View window, accessed by clicking on the
    Variable View tab at the bottom left corner of the window. The
    columns of this window show various pieces of information about the
    variables. Take a little while familiarising yourself with them. The
    most important of the columns in Variable View are

    -   **Name** of the variable in the SPSS data file. The names in
        this column (also shown as the column headings in Data View)
        will be used to refer to specific variables in all of the
        instructions for these computer classes.

    -   **Type** of the variable. Here most of the variables are
        *Numeric*, i.e. numbers, and a few are *String*, which means
        text. Clicking on the entry for a variable in this column and
        then on the button (with three dots on it) revealed by this
        shows a list of other possibilities.

    -   **Width** and **Decimals** control the total number of digits
        and the number of decimal places displayed in Data View.
        Clicking on an entry in these columns reveals buttons which can
        be used to increase or decrease these values. Here all but two
        of the numeric variables are coded as whole numbers, so Decimals
        has been set to 0 for them.

    -   **Label** is used to enter a longer description of the variable.
        Double-clicking on an entry allows you to edit the text.

    -   **Values** shows labels for individual values of a variable.
        This is mostly relevant for categorical variables, such as most
        of the ones in these data. Such variables are coded in the data
        set as numbers, and the Values entry maintains a record of the
        meanings of the categories the numbers correspond to. You can
        see examples of this by clicking on some of the entries in the
        Values column and then on the resulting button. The value labels
        can also be displayed for each observation in Data View by
        selecting **View/Value Labels** in that window.

    -    **Missing** specifies *missing data
        codes*, i.e. values which are not actual measurements but
        indicators that an observation should be treated as missing.
        There may be several such codes. For example, variables in these
        data often have separate missing data codes for cases where a
        respondent was never asked a question (“Not applicable”, often
        abbreviated NAP), replied “Don’t know” (DK) or otherwise failed
        to provide an answer (“Refusal” or “No answer”; NA); the
        explanations of these values are found in the Values column. An
        alternative to using missing data codes (so-called *User
        missing* values) is to enter no value (a *System missing* value)
        for an observation in the data matrix. This is displayed as a
        full stop (.) in Data View. There are no such values in
        these data.

    -   **Measure** indicates the measurement level of a variable, as
        *Nominal*, *Ordinal* or *Scale* (meaning interval). This is
        mostly for the user’s information, as SPSS makes little use of
        this specification.

3.  Any changes made to the data file are preserved by saving it again
    from **File/Save** (or by clicking on the Save File button of the
    toolbar, which the one with the picture of a diskette). You will
    also be prompted to do so when exiting SPSS or when trying to open a
    new data file. Today you should not save any changes you may have
    made to ESS5\_sample.sav, so click **No** if prompted to do
    so below.

#### Part 2: Descriptive statistics for categorical variables {-}

Most of the statistics required for this class are found in SPSS under
**Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Frequencies** as follows:

-   Names of the variables for which the statistics are requested are
    placed in the **Variable(s)** box. To make it easy to find variables
    in the list box on the left, you may find it convenient to change
    the way the variables are displayed in the list; see under "SPSS Session Options in Section \@ref(s-intro-SPSS) for instructions.

-   Tables of frequencies: select **Display frequency tables**

-   Bar charts: **Charts/Chart Type/Bar charts**. Note that under
    **Chart Values** you can choose between frequencies or percentage
    labels on the vertical axis.

-   Pie charts: **Charts/Chart Type/Pie charts**

In addition, we will construct some two-way tables or cross-tabulations,
by selecting **Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Crosstabs**. In the dialog
box that opens, request a contingency table between two variables by
entering

-   The name of the row variable into the **Row(s)** box, and

-   The name of the column variable into the **Column(s)** box.

-   **Cells/Percentages** for percentages within the table: **Row**
    gives percentages within each row (i.e. frequencies divided by row
    totals), **Column** percentages within columns, and **Total**
    percentages out of the total sample size.

The labels in the SPSS output should be self-explanatory. Note that in
this and all subsequent classes, the output may also include some
entries corresponding to methods and statistics not discussed on this
course. They can be ignored here.

1.  The first variable in the data set, GOODJOB, asks respondents
    whether they generally feel that the police are doing a good job in
    their country. There are three response categories for this item: “a
    good job”, “neither a good job nor a bad job”, or “a bad job”.
    Obtain a frequency table and bar chart to investigate the
    distribution of responses to this question.

    Check that you understand how to interpret the output you obtain. In
    particular, make sure that you understand the information displayed
    in each of the columns in the main table, and that you can see the
    connection between the information in the table and the information
    represented in the bar chart.

2.  The last variable in the set, AGE\_GRP, records in which of the
    following age groups each respondent falls: up to 29 years of age,
    30-49, or 50+ years. Let us consider the association between age
    group and opinions of the police. Obtain a two-way contingency table
    of GOODJOB by AGE\_GRP. To make interpretation easier, request
    percentages within each of the age groups. If you use AGE\_GRP as
    the row variable, then include row percentages in the output.

    Interpret the resulting table. Are opinions of the police
    distributed differently among the three different age groups? Does
    there appear to be an association between age group and attitude?

3.  If you have time after completing the data entry exercise (below),
    you may wish to return to this data set and explore frequencies and
    contingency tables for some of the other variables in the set.

\newpage

#### Part 3: Entering data directly into Data Editor {-}

This procedure may be useful to know if the data you are analysing are
not in any electronic form at the beginning of the analysis, for example
if you start with a pile of filled-in questionnaires from a survey. For
practice, we will enter the following small, artificial data set:

Sex: Man; Age: 45; Weight: 11 st 3 lbs\
Sex: Woman; Age: 68; Weight: 8 st 2 lbs\
Sex: Woman; Age: 17; Weight: 9 st 6 lbs\
Sex: Man; Age: 28; Weight: 13 st 8 lbs\
Sex: Woman; Age: 16; Weight: 7 st 8lbs

1.  Select **File/New/Data** to clear the Data Editor. Go to Variable
    View and enter into the first four rows of the Name column names for
    the variables, for example *sex*, *age*, *wstones* and *wpounds*.

2.  Switch to Data View and type the data above into the appropriate
    columns, one unit (respondent) per row. Note that the person’s
    weight is entered into two columns, one for stones and one
    for pounds. Enter sex using numerical codes, e.g. 1 for women and 2
    for men.

3.  Save the file as a new SPSS data file (**File/Save as**), giving it
    a name of your choice. You should also resave the file (from
    **File/Save** or by clicking the File Save button) after each of the
    changes made below.

4.  Practise modifying the information in Variable View by adding the
    following information for the sex variable:

    -   Enter the label *Sex of the respondent* into the Label column.

    -   Click on the Values cell and then on the resulting button to
        open a dialog box for entering value labels. Enter **Value:**
        *1*; **Value Label**: *Woman*; **Add**. Repeat for men, and
        click **OK** when finished.

5.  **Transforming variables**: It is often necessary to derive new
    variables from existing ones. We will practise the two most common
    examples of this:

    1.  **Creating a grouped variable**: Suppose, for example, that we
        want to define a grouped age variable with three categories:
        less than 25 years, 25–54 and 55 or over. This is done as
        follows:

        -   Select **Transform/Recode into Different Variables**. This
            opens a dialog box which is used to define the rule for how
            values of the existing variable are to be grouped into
            categories of the new one.

        -   Move the name of the age variable to the **Input Variable
            –$>$ Output Variable** box.

        -   Under **Output Variable**, enter the **Name** of the new
            variable, for example *agegroup*, and click **Change**.

        -   Click on **Old and New Values**. Enter **Old Value/Range:
            Lowest through** *24* and **New Value/Value:** *1*, and
            click **Add**.

        -   Repeat for the other two categories, selecting **Range:**
            *25* **through** **54** and **Range:** *55* **through
            highest** for **Old value**, and *2* and *3* respectively
            for **New value**.

        -   You should now see the correct grouping instructions in the
            **Old –$\mathbf{>}$ New** box. Click **Continue** and **OK**
            to create the new variable.

        -   Check the new variable in Data View. At this stage you
            should normally enter in Variable View the value labels of
            the age groups.

    2.  **Calculations on variables**: Some new variables are obtained
        through mathematical calculations on existing ones. For example,
        suppose we want to include weight in kilograms as well as stones
        and pounds. Using the information that one stone is equal to
        6.35 kg and one pound is about 0.45 kg, the transformation is
        carried out as follows:

        -   Select **Transform/Compute Variable**. This opens a dialog
            box which is used to define the rule for calculating the
            values of the new variable.

        -   Enter **Target variable:** *weightkg* (for example; this is
            the name of the new variable) and **Numeric Expression:**
            *6.35 \* wstones + 0.45 \* wpounds*; for the latter, you can
            either type in the formula or use the variable list and
            calculator buttons in a fairly obvious way.


#### WEEK 2 HOMEWORK {-}

The homework exercise for this week is to complete the multiple choice
quiz which you can find in the Moodle resource for MY451. Answers to the
questions are also included there, including feedback on why the
incorrect answer are incorrect. The first part of the quiz asks for
answers to the class exercise, and the second part asks you to identify
the level of measurement of some different variables.

## WEEK 3 class:\
Descriptive statistics for continuous variables

**Data set:** The data file used today is
**london-borough-profiles.sav**. It contains a selection of data on the
33 London boroughs obtained from the *London Datastore*, which publishes
a range of statistical data about the city, collated by the Greater
London Authority’s *GLA Intelligence Unit* [^2].


#### Descriptive statistics in SPSS {-}


This week you will produce and examine descriptive statistics for a
number of individual variables. As for last week, almost all of the
statistics required for this class can be obtained in SPSS under
**Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Frequencies**. Note that you will
probably not find the tables of frequencies very useful, because
continuous variables can take so many different values. So for this
class, uncheck the **Display frequency tables** option in the dialog
box.

-   Measures of central tendency: **Mean**, **Median** and **Mode**
    under **Statistics / Central Tendency**

-   Measures of variation: **Range**, **Std. deviation** and
    **Variance** under **Statistics/Dispersion**. For the Interquartile
    range, select **Statistics/ Percentile values/Quartiles** and
    calculate by hand the difference between the third and first
    quartiles given (as Percentiles 75 and 25 respectively) in
    the output.

-   Histograms: **Charts/Chart Type/Histograms**

Two charts needed today are not found under the Frequencies procedure:

-   **Stem and leaf plots**, which are obtained from
    **Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Explore** by entering variable(s)
    under **Dependent list** and selecting **Display/Plots** and
    **Plots/Descriptive/Stem-and-leaf**. You can place more than one
    variable under the **Dependent list** in order to compare variables.

-   **Box plots** are also automatically generated through this dialog
    box, regardless of whether you want to see them! So this is the
    simplest way to produce them.

Most of these statistics and charts can be obtained in other ways as
well, for example from **Analyze/ Descriptive Statistics/Descriptives**
or **Graphs/Legacy Dialogs/Histogram**, or **Graphs/Legacy
Dialogs/Boxplot**, but we will not use these alternatives today. Feel
free to investigate them in your own time if you wish.

The labels in the SPSS output should be self-explanatory. Note that in
this and all subsequent classes, the output may also include some
entries corresponding to methods and statistics not discussed on this
course. They can be ignored here.

#### Classwork {-}

1.  The variable *YOUTH\_DEPRIVATION* records for each borough the
    percentage of children who live in out-of-work families. This is an
    indicator of deprivation, with higher values indicating a worse
    situation for each borough. Investigate the distribution of this
    variable across London boroughs by obtaining its mean, median,
    minimum and maximum, quartiles and standard deviation, and
    a histogram. Obtain also a stem and leaf plot and a box plot. Note
    that double-clicking on a histogram (or any other SPSS graph) opens
    it in a new window, where the graph can be further edited by
    changing titles, colours etc. The graph can also be exported from
    SPSS into other software. Check that you understand how to find the
    measures of central tendency and dispersion from the output. Does
    the distribution of YOUTH\_DEPRIVATION appear to be symmetrically
    distributed or skewed?

2.  Consider now the variable *CRIME*, which records the numbers of
    reported crimes for every 1000 inhabitants, over the years 2011-12.
    Obtain some summary descriptive statistics, a histogram and a box
    plot for this variable. Is the distribution of the variable
    symmetric or skewed to the left or right? *CRIME* is one of many
    variables in this data set which have outliers, i.e. boroughs with
    unusually large or small values of the variable. Normally
    statistical analysis focuses on the whole data rather than
    individual observations, but the identities of individual outliers
    are often also of interest. The outliers can be seen most easily in
    the box plots, where SPSS labels them with their case numbers, so
    that you can identify them easily in the data set. For example, 1
    would indicate the 1st case in the data set. If you click on to the
    Data View you can see that this 1st case is the City of London.
    Which borough is the outlier for CRIME?

#### HOMEWORK {-}

For the questions below, select the relevant SPSS output to include in
your homework and write brief answers to the specific questions.
Remember SPSS produces some outputs that you do not need. Feel free to
transcribe tables or modify charts if you wish to improve their
presentation.

1.  The variable *VOTING* records voter turnout in a borough,
    specifically the percentage of eligible voters who voted in the
    local elections in 2010. Obtain descriptive statistics, a histogram
    and a box plot for this variable. What is the range of the variable,
    and what is its inter-quartile range? Are there any outliers? Is the
    distribution of voter turnout symmetrical or skewed? How you can you
    tell?

2.  In the data set employment rates are given overall, but also
    separately for males and females. The employment rate is the
    percentage of working age population who are in employment. Compare
    and contrast male and female employment rates across the boroughs,
    using the variables *MALE\_EMPLOYMENT* and *FEMALE\_EMPLOYMENT*.
    Comment on the differences and/or similarities in their descriptive
    statistics: minimum and maximum, mean, median and
    standard deviation. Obtain histograms for these two variables. Are
    the distributions of male employment and female employment
    symmetrical or skewed?

\newpage

## WEEK 4 class: Two-way contingency tables

**Data set**: The data file used today is **GSS2010.sav**. It contains a
selection of variables on attitudes and demographic characteristics for
2044 respondents in the 2010 U.S. General Social Survey (GSS)[^3]. The
full data set contains 790 variables. For convenience the version you
are analysing today contains just a selection of those items.

#### Analysing two-way contingency tables in SPSS {-}

All of the analyses needed for this week’s class are found under
**Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Crosstabs**. We will be obtaining
contingency tables between two variables, as in Week 2 class, with the
following commands:

-   The name of the row variable into the **Row(s)** box, and

-   The name of the column variable into the **Column(s)** box.

-   **Cells/Percentages** for percentages within the table: **Row**
    gives percentages within each row (i.e. frequencies divided by row
    totals), **Column** percentages within columns, and **Total**
    percentages out of the total sample size.

The only additional output we will need today is obtained by selecting

-   **Statistics/Chi-square** for the $\chi^{2}$ test of independence

-   (If you are interested in the $\gamma$ measure of association for
    ordinal variables, outlined in the coursepack, you may obtain it
    using **Statistics/Ordinal/Gamma**. In the output the
    $\gamma$ statistic is shown in the “Symmetric measures” table in the
    “Value” column for “Gamma”. We will not use this measure today, but
    feel free to ask if you are interested in it.)

#### Classwork {-}

Suppose we want to use the GSS data to investigate whether in the
U.S. population sex and age are associated with attitudes towards
women’s roles. The respondent’s sex is included in the data as the
variable *SEX*, and age as *AGEGROUP* in three groups: 18-34, 35-54, and
55 or over. The three attitude variables we consider are

-   *FEFAM*: Level of agreement with the following statement: “It is
    much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside
    the home and the woman takes care of the home and family”. Available
    response options are Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree, and
    Strongly disagree.

-   FEPOL: Level of agreement with the following statement: “Most men
    are better suited emotionally for politics than are most women”.
    Available response options are: Agree and Disagree.

-   *FEPRES*: Response to the following statement: “If your party
    nominated a woman for President, would you vote for her if she were
    qualified for the job?” Available response options are Yes and No.

1.  Consider first the association between sex and attitude towards male
    and female work roles, by constructing a contingency table between
    *SEX* and *FEFAM*. To make interpretation of the results easier,
    include also appropriate percentages. Here it makes most sense to
    treat sex as an explanatory variable for attitude, so we want to
    examine percentages of attitudes within categories of male
    and female. If you use *SEX* as the row variable, this means
    including the Row percentages in the output. Request also the
    $\chi^{2}$-test statistic. In SPSS output, results for the
    $\chi^{2}$ test are given below the two-way table itself in a table
    labelled “Chi-Square Tests”, in the row “Pearson Chi-Square”. The
    test statistic itself is given under “Value” and its $P$-value under
    “Asymp. Sig. (2-sided)”. By considering the $\chi^{2}$ test
    statistic and its $P$-value, do you think there is enough evidence
    to conclude that males and females differ in their views on male and
    female work roles? If there is, how would you describe the
    association?

2.  Consider now the association between age and attitude towards male
    and female work roles, by constructing a table between *AGEGROUP*
    and *FEFAM*. Interpret the results, and compare them to your
    findings in Exercise 1.

3.  Examine differences between men and women in their views about
    women’s suitability for politics, using a table between *SEX* and
    *FEPOL*. Interpret the results. (Note: ignore the last two columns
    of the $\chi^{2}$ test output, labelled ‘Exact Sig. (2-sided)’’ and
    ‘Exact Sig. (1-sided)’’, and use the result under
    “Asymp. Sig. (2-sided)” as in the other tables.)

#### HOMEWORK {-}

1.  What is the null hypothesis for the $\chi^{2}$ test that you carried
    out in analysis 2 in the class, for the table of *AGEGROUP* by
    *FEFAM*?

2.  State the $\chi^{2}$ test statistic, degrees of freedom and
    $P$-value for this table, and interpret these results.

3.  Interpret the table of percentages to describe the nature of the
    association between *AGEGROUP* and *FEFAM*.

4.  Consider now the association between age and attitude towards voting
    for a female President, by constructing a table between *AGEGROUP*
    and *FEPRES*. In the population, do people in different age groups
    differ in their willingness to vote for a female President?
    Interpret the results of the $\chi^{2}$ test and illustrate your
    answer with one or two percentages from the two-way table.

## WEEK 5 class: Inference for two population means

**Data set**: The data file used today is **ESS5\_GBFR.sav**. It
contains data for a selection of variables from the 2010 European Social
Survey for respondents in Great Britain and France[^4]. Only a few of
the variables are used in the exercises; the rest are included in the
data set as examples of the kinds of information obtained from this
survey.


**Two-sample inference for means in SPSS**


-   $t$-tests and confidence intervals for two independent samples for
    inference on the difference of the population means:
    **Analyze/Compare Means/Independent-Samples T Test**. The variable
    of interest $Y$ is placed under **Test Variable(s)** and the
    explanatory variable $X$ under **Grouping Variable**. The values of
    $X$ identifying the two groups being compared are defined under
    **Define Groups**.

-   *Box plots* for descriptive purposes are obtained from
    **Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Explore**. Here we want to draw
    side-by-side box plots for values of a response variable $Y$, one
    plot for each distinct value of an explanatory variable $X$. The
    name of $Y$ is placed under **Dependent List** and that of $X$ under
    **Factor List**. Box plots are obtained by selecting
    **Plots/Boxplots/Factor levels together**.

-   Tests and confidence intervals for single means (c.f. Section
    \@ref(s-means-1sample)) are not considered today. These are obtained
    from **Analyze/Compare Means/One-Sample T Test**. They can also be
    used to carry out inference for comparisons of means between two
    *dependent* samples (c.f. Section \@ref(s-means-dependent)).

**Classwork**\
Consider the survey data in the file *ESS5\_GBFR.sav*. We will examine
two variables, and carry out statistical inference to compare their
means among the survey populations of adults in Great Britain and
France[^5].

1.  The variable *WKHTOT* shows the number of hours per week the
    respondent normally works in his or her main job. Obtain box plots
    and descriptive statistics for this variable separately for each
    country (identified by the variable *CNTRY*). Compare measures of
    central tendency and variation for *WKHTOT* between the two
    countries. What do you observe?

2.  Obtain a $t$-test and confidence interval for the difference of
    weekly working hours between Britain and France (specify the values
    of the country variable as **Define Groups/Group 1:** *GB* and
    **Group 2:** *FR* as coded in the data). Details of SPSS output for
    this are explained in Chapter \@ref(c-means); you can use the results
    under the assumption of equal population variances. What do you
    conclude? Is there a statistically significant difference in the
    average values of *WKHTOT* between the two countries? What does the
    confidence interval suggest about the size of the difference?

3.  The variable *STFJBOT* asks those in paid work, “How satisfied are
    you with the balance between the time you spend on your paid work
    and the time you spend on other aspects of your life?”. Respondents
    are asked to rate their level of satisfaction on a scale from 0-10,
    where 0 means “Extremely dissatisfied” and 10 means “Extremely
    satisfied”. Repeat exercises 1 and 2 for this variable, and compare
    also histograms of *STFJBOT* for each country. What do you observe?

**HOMEWORK**

1.  Write up your answers to the second class exercise, answering these
    specific questions:

    1.  What are the observed sample means for *WKHTOT* for French and
        British respondents?

    2.  Is there a statistically significant difference in the average
        values of *WKHTOT* between the two countries? State the value of
        the test statistic and its corresponding $P$-value. You may
        assume equal population variances for this test.

    3.  Interpret the 95% confidence interval for the difference.

2.  The variable *WKHSCH* asks respondents, “How many hours a week, if
    any, would you choose to work, bearing in mind that your earnings
    would go up or down according to how many hours you work?”. Is there
    a statistically significant difference between ideal (rather
    than actual) work hours for French and British respondents? Carry
    out a t-test and report and interpret the results.

3.  The variable *STFMJOB* asks respondents, “How satisfied are you in
    your main job?”. Respondents are asked to rate their level of
    satisfaction on a scale from 0-10, where 0 means “Extremely
    dissatisfied” and 10 means “Extremely satisfied”. Is there a
    statistically significant difference, at the 5% level of
    significance, between mean levels of job satisfaction for French and
    British respondents? Answer this question by using the 95%
    confidence interval for the difference in means (you need the full
    t-test output to obtain the confidence interval, but you need not
    report the results of the t-test itself for this question).

## WEEK 7 class: Inference for population proportions

**Data sets**: Files **BES2010post\_lastdebate.sav** and
**BES2010pre\_lastdebate.sav**.


**Inference on proportions in SPSS**

-   SPSS menus do not provide procedures for calculating the tests and
    confidence intervals for proportions discussed in Chapter
    \@ref(c-probs). This is not a serious limitation, as the calculations
    are quite simple.

-   It is probably easiest to use a pocket calculator for the
    calculations, and this is the approach we recommend for this class.
    The only part of the analysis it cannot do is calculating the
    precise $P$-value for the tests, but even this can be avoided by
    using critical values from a statistical table such as the one at
    the end of this Coursepack to determine approximate $P$-values (or
    by using an online $P$-value calculator — see “About Week 4 class”
    on the Moodle page for suggested links).

#### Classwork {-}

The survey data set *BES2010post\_lastdebate.sav* contains part of the
information collected by the British Election Study, an ongoing research
programme designed to understand voter choices in the UK [^6].

In the run-up to the UK General Election on 6 May 2010, opinion polls
reported quite dramatic changes in popularity of the Liberal Democrat
party. Key to their increasing popularity was the performance of their
party leader, Nick Clegg, in a series of three televised debates between
the leaders of the three main political parties (the other participants
were Gordon Brown for Labour and David Cameron for the Conservative
party). The debates were broadcast between 15 and 29 April 2010.

The data in *BES2010post\_lastdebate.sav* contain information on
respondents’ voting intentions, obtained after the debates had ended
(i.e. between 30 April and 6 May).

1.  *VOTE\_LIBDEM* is a dichotomous variable indicating whether a
    respondent intended to vote for the Liberal Democrats (value 1) or
    some other party (0) in the 2010 General Election. The value of this
    variable is by definition missing for those who had not decided
    which way they would vote or who did not intend to vote at all, so
    they are automatically excluded from the analysis. The parameter of
    interest $\pi$ is now the population proportion of those who *say*
    they would vote Liberal Democrat. We will compare it to 0.23, the
    proportion of the vote the party actually received in 2010. The
    analysis is thus one-sample inference on a population proportion,
    and the relevant formulas are (\@ref(ztestp))
    for the test statistic and (\@ref(cip2)) for the
    confidence interval.

    -   Begin by creating a frequency table of *VOTE\_LIBDEM*. This
        should show that the sample estimate of $\pi$ is 0.260, out of
        $3226$ non-missing responses. Thus $n=3226$ and
        $\hat{\pi}=0.260$ in the notation of Chapter \@ref(c-probs).

    -   For the one-sample significance test, the value of $\pi$ under
        the null hypothesis is $\pi_{0}=0.230$. Using equation
        (\@ref(ztestp)), the value of the test statistic $z$ is thus
        given by the calculation
        $$z = \frac{0.260-0.230}{\sqrt{0.230\times (1-0.230)/3226}}$$
        Calculate this using a calculator. The result should be
        $z=4.049$.

    -   The (two-sided) $P$-value for this is the probability that a
        value from the standard normal distribution is at most $-4.049$
        or at least 4.049. Evaluate this approximately by comparing the
        value of $z$ to critical values from the standard normal
        distribution (c.f. Table \@ref(tab:t-ttable)) as explained in Section
        \@ref(ss-probs-test1sample-samplingd). Here, for example, $z$ is
        larger than 1.96, so the two-sided $P$-value must be smaller
        than 0.05. Convince yourself that you understand this statement.

    -   Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population
        proportion of prospective Liberal Democrat voters, using
        equation (\@ref(cip2)).

    What do you conclude about the proportions of prospective and actual
    Liberal Democrat voters? Why might the two differ from each other?

2.  The variable *TVDEBATE* indicates whether the respondent reports
    having watched any of the three televised debates (1 for Yes, at
    least one watched, 0 otherwise - this includes “no” and “don’t
    know” responses). We will compare the proportion of people intending
    to vote Liberal Democrat amongst those who watched some or all of
    the debates with those who did not, using the two-sample methods of
    analysis discussed in Section \@ref(s-probs-2samples). The formula of
    the $z$-test statistic for testing the hypothesis of equal
    population proportions is thus (\@ref(ztestDpi)), and a confidence interval for the difference of
    the porportions is (\@ref(ciDpi)).

    -   Begin by calculating the relevant sample proportions. The
        easiest way to do this is by creating a two-way contingency
        table between *TVDEBATE* and *VOTE\_LIBDEM* as you did in the
        Week 2 and 4 classes. The results required for the analysis
        considered here are all shown in the resulting table. Convince
        yourself that these show that, in the notation of Section
        \@ref(s-probs-2samples),

        -   $n_{1}=930$ and $\hat{\pi}_{1}=0.218\; (=203/930)$,

        -   $n_{2}=2296$ and $\hat{\pi}_{2}=0.277\; (=636/2296)$,

        where 1 denotes respondents who did not watch any of the debates
        and 2 those who watched at least some. The pooled estimated
        proportion $\hat{\pi}$ (formula \@ref(phat2sample)) used in the
        test statistic (\@ref(ztestDpi)) is here $\hat{\pi}=0.260$, shown
        on the “Total” row.

    -   Calculate the test statistic, its $P$-value and a 95% confidence
        for the difference in population proportions, using the
        relevant formulas. For example, the test statistic is here given
        by $$z= \frac{0.277-0.218}{\sqrt{0.260\times (1-0.260)\times
        (1/2296+1/930)}}.$$

    What do you conclude? Is there evidence that those who watched at
    least some of the leaders’ debates were more likely to declare an
    intention to vote Liberal Democrat? If there is, how big is the
    difference in proportions of prospective Liberal Democrat voters
    between the debate-watchers and debate-non-watchers?

#### HOMEWORK {-}

Write up your answers to the second class exercise. In particular,
answer the following specific questions:

1.  What proportion of respondents say that they did watch at least some
    of the leaders’ debates? And what proportion did not? Of those who
    watched at least some of the leaders’ debates, what proportion said
    they intended to vote Liberal Democrat? And what proportion of those
    who did *not* watch any of the leaders’ debates said they intended
    to vote Liberal Democrat?

2.  Calculate the test statistic and find its corresponding approximate
    $P$-value for the difference in population proportions of
    prospective Liberal Democrat voters among those who did and did not
    watch the leaders’ debates. Show your working. State the conclusion
    from the test.

3.  Calculate a 95% confidence interval around this difference. State
    its lower and upper limits.

4.  Write a brief substantive interpretation of your results.

The data set *BES2010pre\_lastdebate.sav* contains responses to the same
question - whether respondents intended to vote Liberal Democrat or not
- but asked before the last of the party leaders’ debates. Repeat the
analysis you carried out for the first class exercise, but using this
data set. In other words carry out a one-sample analysis, of the kind
done in exercise 1 above, to compare the proportion of respondents who
said they intended to vote Liberal Democrat with the proportion who
actually did. Answer the following questions:

1.  State the null hypothesis for the test.

2.  Calculate the test statistic and find its corresponding approximate
    $P$-value. Show your workings.

3.  Give a brief interpretation of the results. Do they differ from the
    other data set? Can you think of any reasons for this? (This last
    question invites some speculation - do not worry if you don’t have
    any ideas! But see the sample answer if you are interested in
    our speculation.)

## WEEK 7 class: Correlation and simple linear regression 1

**Data set**: Files **decathlon2012.sav**.

#### Scatterplots, correlation and simple linear regression in SPSS {-}

-   A scatterplot is obtained from **Graphs/Legacy
    Dialogs/“Scatter/Dot”/ Simple Scatter/Define**. The variables for
    the $X$-axis and $Y$-axis are placed in the **X Axis** and **Y
    Axis** boxes respectively. Double-clicking on the plot in the Output
    window opens it in a *Chart Editor*, where various additions to the
    graph can be made. A fitted straight line is added from
    **Elements/Fit Line at Total**. A least squares fitted line is the
    default under this option, so it is drawn immediately and you can
    just click **Close**. Closing the Chart Editor commits the changes
    to the Output window.

-   A correlation matrix is obtained from
    **Analyze/Correlate/Bivariate**, when **Correlation
    Coefficients/Pearson** is selected (which is the default, so you
    should not need to change it). The variables included in the
    correlation matrix are placed into the **Variables** box. The output
    also includes a test for the hypothesis that the population
    correlation is 0, but we will ignore it.

-   Linear regression models are obtained from
    **Analyze/Regression/Linear**. The response variable is placed under
    **Dependent** and the explanatory variable under **Independent(s)**.
    The dialog box has many options for various additional choices.
    Today you can leave all of them at their default values, except that
    you should select **Statistics/Regression Coefficients/Confidence
    intervals** to include also 95% confidence intervals for the
    regression coefficients in the output.

#### Classwork {-}

Decathlon is a sport where the participants complete ten different
athletics events over two days. Their results in each are then
translated into points, and the winner is the competitor with the
highest points total for the ten events. The file *decathlon2012.sav*
contains the results of the decathlon competition at the 2012 Olympics
in London for the 26 athletes who finished the competition.[^7] The
results for each event are given both in their original units (variables
with names beginning with “mark\_”) and in decathlon points (names
beginning with “points\_”). The ten events are identified by the
variable labels in Variable View. The variable *points\_total* gives the
final points total for each competitor.

1.  Create a scatterplot between the result ($X$-axis) and points
    ($Y$-axis) for one event, the 100-metre sprint (variables
    *MARK\_100M* and *POINTS\_100M*), and add a fitted line. This simply
    provides information on the calculation used to transform the result
    into points. Clearly a linear calculation is used for this, at least
    over the range of results in these data. Notice the downward slope
    of the line: the faster the result, the higher the number of points.
    From now on, for simplicity we will consider only the points
    variables for each event.

2.  Obtain the correlation matrix for all pairs of variables among the
    ten individual points scores and the total score. Consider first
    correlations between the individual events only. Which correlations
    tend to be high (say over 0.5), which ones close to zero and which
    ones even negative? Can you think of any reasons for this? Draw
    scatterplots and fitted lines for a few pairs of variables with
    different sizes of correlations (here the variables are treated
    symmetrically, so it does not matter which one is placed on the
    $X$-axis). Can these associations be reasonably described as linear?

3.  Consider now the correlations between the ten event scores and the
    final score *POINTS\_TOTAL*. Which of them is highest, and which one
    lowest? Examine the scatterplot and fitted line between points for
    100 metres (*POINTS\_100M*) and the total score (POINTS\_TOTAL). Fit
    a line to this scatterplot variables, with *POINTS\_100M* as the
    explanatory variable. Interpret the results. Does there appear to be
    an association between the points for 100 metres and the total
    score? What is the nature of the association?

    Suppose you were told that a competitor received 800 points (a time
    of about 11.3 seconds) for 100 metres, the first event of the
    decathlon. Based on the fitted model, what final points score would
    you predict for him? You can calculate this fitted value with a
    pocket calculator. What would be the predicted value if the
    100-metre score was 950 points (about 10.6 s) instead?

**HOMEWORK**

1.  Briefly discuss the correlation matrix produced in the class. Pick
    out a few examples for illustration - which correlations are
    highest, and which ones lowest, and which ones negative? You may
    comment on correlations between individual events, as well as on
    correlations between the final score and individual events.

2.  Obtain the scatterplot and linear regression model for the total
    score given points for the long jump, one of the field
    events (POINTS\_LONGJUMP). Is the score for long jump strongly or
    weakly associated with the final score? Interpret the
    slope coefficient. Suppose you were told that a competitor received
    900 points (a jump of about 7.4 metres) for the long jump. Based on
    the fitted model, what final points score would you predict for him?

3.  Obtain the scatterplot and linear regression model for the total
    score given points for throwing the discus, another of the field
    events (POINTS\_DISCUS). Interpret the slope coefficient. Is the
    score for discus strongly or weakly associated with the final score?

## WEEK 8 class: Simple linear regression and 3-way tables

**Data set**: File **GSS2010.SAV**. This contains a selection of
variables on attitudes and demographic characteristics for 2044
respondents in the 2010 U.S. General Social Survey (GSS)[^8]. Only a few
of the variables are used in the exercises.

#### Classwork - linear regression {-}

Here we will focus on the variables *EDUC*, *PAEDUC*, *MAEDUC* and
*SPEDUC*. These show the number of years of education completed by,
respectively, the survey respondent him/herself, and the respondent’s
father, mother and spouse.

1.  Obtain basic descriptive statistics for the variables. Here they can
    be compared directly, because the meaning of the variable is similar
    in each case. We can even draw side-by-side box plots for the
    variables (rather than for values of a single variable at different
    levels of another, as before). These can be obtained from
    **Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Explore** by placing all the
    variables under **Dependent List** and selecting
    **Plots/Boxplots/Dependents together**. You should then also select
    **Options/Missing Values/Exclude cases pairwise** to include all
    non-missing values for each variable (here *SPEDUC* has for obvious
    reasons more missing values than the others).

2.  Obtain the correlation matrix of the four variables. Which
    correlations are highest, and which ones lowest?

3.  Draw a scatterplot with fitted line for *EDUC* given *PAEDUC*. Fit a
    linear regression model between these variables, regressiong *EDUC*
    (response variable) on *PAEDUC* (explanatory variable). Interpret
    the results. Is there a statistically significant linear association
    between a person’s years of schooling and those of his/her father?
    Interpret the estimated regression coefficient, $t$-statistic and
    $P$-value, and 95 per cent confidence interval.

4.  Based on the fitted model, what is the predicted number of years of
    education for a respondent whose father completed 12 years of
    education?

#### HOMEWORK: Simple linear regression and three-way tables {-}

The homework exercise uses the same data set for two different types of
analysis.

#### Linear regression {-}

Draw a scatterplot with fitted line for *EDUC* given *MAEDUC*. Fit a
linear regression model between these variables, regressiong *EDUC*
(response variable) on *MAEDUC* (explanatory variable).

1.  Interpret the results: Is there a statistically significant linear
    association between a person’s years of schooling and those of
    his/her mother? Interpret the estimated regression coefficient,
    $t$-statistic and $P$-value, and 95 per cent confidence interval.

2.  Based on the fitted model, what is the predicted number of years of
    education for a respondent whose mother completed 10 years of
    education?

3.  Interpret the R-squared statistic for the model.

#### Analysing multiway contingency tables in SPSS {-}

Three-way contingency tables are again obtained from
**Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Crosstabs**. The only change from Week
4 class is that the conditioning variable is now placed in the **Layer 1
of 1** box. This produces a series of partial two-way tables between the
row and column variables specified in the **Row(s)** and **Column(s)**
boxes, one for each category of the **Layer** variable. Percentages and
$\chi^{2}$ test are similarly calculated separately for each partial
table. For this example we elaborate on the first two exercises from
Week 4 class. To remind you, the categorical variables we are analysing
are these:

-   The respondent’s sex, recorded as the variable *SEX*.

-   age as *AGEGROUP* in three groups: 18-34, 35-54 and 55 or over.

-   *FEFAM*: Level of agreement with the following statement: “It is
    much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside
    the home and the woman takes care of the home and family”, with
    response options Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree, and
    Strongly disagree.

1.  First remind yourself of the associations between SEX and FEFAM and
    between AGEGROUP and FEFAM. Obtain the two-way contingency table
    between *FEFAM* and *SEX*, including appropriate percentages and
    $\chi^{2}$ test of independence. Repeat the procedure for *FEFAM* by
    *AGEGROUP*. What do you learn about the associations between
    attitude and sex, and between attitude and age?

2.  Sociologists would suggest that the relationship between sex and
    attitude towards male and female work roles might be different for
    different age groups. In other words, age might modify the
    association between sex and attitude. Investigate this possible
    interaction between the three variables. Create a three-way table
    where *FEFAM* is the column variable, *SEX* the row variable and
    *AGEGROUP* the layer (conditioning) variable. Study the SPSS output,
    and make sure you understand how this shows three partial tables of
    *FEFAM* vs.*SEX*, one for each possible value of *AGEGROUP*. Examine
    and interpret the associations in the three partial tables. State
    the results of the $\chi^{2}$ test for each partial table, and
    illustrate your interpretations with some appropriate percentages.
    Finally, summarise your findings: are there differences in the
    nature, strength or significance of the association between sex and
    attitude, depending on the age group? Comment on how this
    interpretation differs from the initial two-way table of *FEFAM* and
    *SEX*.

## WEEK 9 class: Multiple linear regression

**Data set**: File **humandevelopment2011.sav**.


#### Multiple linear regression in SPSS {-}

-   Multiple linear regression is obtained from
    **Analyze/Regression/Linear**, by placing all of the required
    explanatory variables in the **Independent(s)** box. No other
    changes from last week are required.

-   To include categorical explanatory variables, the necessary dummy
    variables have to be created first. The ones for today’s class are
    already included in the data set. If you need to create dummy
    variables for your own analyses in the future, it is usually easiest
    to do so from **Transform/Compute Variable**. Some of the buttons on
    the keypad shown in that dialog box are *logical operators* for
    defining conditions for which the outcome is either 1 (True) or 0
    (False), as required by a dummy variable. For example, the
    categorical variable *INCOME\_GROUP* in today’s data set has the
    value 3 if the country is in the high income group. The dummy
    variable *HIGH\_INCOME* was created from this by entering **Target
    Variable:** *HIGH\_INCOME* and **Numeric Expression:**
    *INCOME\_GROUP=3*. This means that the new variable *HIGH\_INCOME*
    will have the value 1 for countries for which *INCOME\_GROUP* is
    equal to 3, and will be 0 otherwise. Other logical operators may
    also be used: for example, *urban\_pop$<$50* would produce 1 if the
    variable *URBAN\_POP* was less than 50 and 0 otherwise.


#### Classwork {-}


The file *humandevelopment2011.sav* contains data on a number of
indicators of what might broadly be called development, for 194
countries in 2011. These were collated from two international data
agency sources[^9]. The response variable considered today is
*SCHOOL\_YEARS*, which records for each country the mean number of years
of schooling taken by the adult population. We treat it here as a
general indicator of the educational situation in a country, which is an
important aspect of development. We will consider the following
explanatory variables for it:

-   *URBAN\_POP*: the degree of urbanisation of the country,
    specifically the percentage of the country’s population living in
    urban areas variable

-   *GOVERNANCE*, a continuous variable contructed from expert opinion
    surveys to reflect the perceived effectiveness of government in
    delivering services.

-   *INFANT\_MORTALITY*, number of infants dying before 1 year old, per
    1,000 live births — a “proxy” indicator representing the health of
    the population

-   *INCOME\_GROUP*, classified as low, middle or high income economies.
    This is also provided in the form of three dummy variables:
    *LOW\_INCOME*, *MIDDLE\_INCOME* and *HIGH\_INCOME*.

1.  Obtain some descriptive statistics for the continuous variables, to
    gain and impression of their ranges. A quick way of doing this is
    via **Analyze/Descriptive Statistics/Frequencies**, unchecking the
    “Display frequency tables” and requesting minimum and
    maximum values.

2.  Investigate the idea that increased urbanisation is linked to
    greater availability of schooling for people. Obtain a scatterplot
    and a simple linear regression model for *SCHOOL\_YEARS* given
    *URBAN\_POP*. What do you observe in the scatterplot? Interpret the
    regression output.

3.  Now consider the possibility that schooling may also be explained by
    the effectiveness of governments in providing public services (such
    as education). Fit a multiple linear regression model for
    *SCHOOL\_YEARS* given both *URBAN\_POP* and *GOVERNANCE*. Compare
    the the estimated coefficient of *URBAN\_POP* for this model with
    the coefficient of the same variable in the model in Question 2.
    What do you conclude? Does the association between schooling and
    urbanisation change when we control for government effectiveness? If
    so, in what way? Interpret the estimate coefficient of *GOVERNANCE*
    in the fitted model, the results of its $t$-test and its 95%
    confidence interval.

4.  Next consider the possible explanatory value of the income wealth of
    a country for understanding variation in schooling years. Include
    income by entering two of the three dummy variables for
    income group. For the most convenient interpretation, we suggest
    that you leave “low income” as the reference group, and enter the
    dummies for *MIDDLE\_INCOME* and *HIGH\_INCOME* in the model.
    Interpret the values of the estimated regression coefficients for
    the two income dummy variables. In addition, for each one state the
    null hypothesis for its $t$-test, and interpret the result of the
    test and 95% confidence intervals.

5.  Using this model, what level of schooling would you predict for a
    country with 70% urban population, a score of 1.5 on governance, and
    a high income economy?

6.  Using this model, what level of schooling would you predict for a
    country with 30% urban population, a score of -0.2 on governance,
    and a low income economy?

**HOMEWORK**

1.  Write up your answers to the last three questions in the
    class exercise.

2.  Finally, consider one more possible explanatory variable:
    *INFANT\_MORTALITY*. Add this variable to the multiple linear
    regression model fitted above. Is it statistically significant, at
    the 1% level of significance? Interpret the value of its estimated
    coefficient, and its 95% confidence interval. Take care to make
    sense of the sign (positive or negative) of the coefficient.

3.  Has the inclusion of *INFANT\_MORTALITY* modified the interpretation
    of any of the other explanatory variables in the model? Are they all
    statistically significant, at the 5% level of significance? Briefly
    outline the similarities and differences between the results for
    this final model and the model fitted in the class exercise.

\newpage

## WEEK 10 class: Review and Multiple linear regression

**Data set**: File **ESS5GB\_trust.sav**.

This class is for you to revisit any topics of your choosing. Make the
most of the opportunity to ask your class teachers any questions you
have about any of the course material, and to practise any of the
analyses you have learned during the course.

As an optional exercise, the data file **ESS5GB\_trust.sav** is
provided. This contains a selection of variables from the survey of
British respondents that forms the 2010 wave of the European Social
Survey[^10].

We suggest that you use the data to practise multiple linear regression
modelling on one or more of the variables capturing people’s levels of
trust in institutions. For these questions, respondents were asked the
following: “Using this card, please tell me on a score of 0-10 how much
you personally trust each of the institutions I read out. 0 means you do
not trust an institution at all, and 10 means you have complete trust.”
The institutions (and their variable names) are:

-   *trstprl*: Trust in country’s parliament

-   *trstlgl*: Trust in the legal system

-   *trstplc*: Trust in the police

-   *trstplt*: Trust in politicians

-   *trstprt*: Trust in political parties

-   *trstep*: Trust in the European Parliament

-   *trstun*: Trust in the United Nations

After you choose a response variable that interests you, you will need
to select some potential explanatory variables to test. The data set
contains a number of variables. Some are socio-demographic, such as age
and gender. Some are attitudinal or behavioural, such as amount of time
spent reading newspapers. You will need to make a judgement about the
levels of measurement of the variables, and how to enter them into the
model. Use the “Values” column in the SPSS Variable View to check how
each variable is coded. Note: we suggest that it is not too much of a
compromise to treat the variables on television, radio and newspaper
consumption as continuous, interval level variables. Note also: we have
provided dummy variables for the categorical variables in the data set.

**HOMEWORK**

As this is the last week of the course, there is no homework. You can
find further information on this and the other class exercises and
homeworks in the model answers, which will be posted in the Moodle site.

#  Statistical tables {#c-disttables}


Explanation of the “Table of standard normal tail probabilities” in Section
\@ref(s_disttables_Z):

-   The table shows, for values of $Z$ between 0 and 3.5, the
    probability that a value from the standard normal distribution is
    *larger than* $Z$ (i.e. the “right-hand” tail probabilities).

    -   For example, the probability of values larger than 0.50
        is 0.3085.

-   For negative values of $Z$, the probability of values *smaller than*
    $Z$ (the “left-hand” tail probability) is equal to the right-hand
    tail probability for the corresponding positive value of $Z$.

    -   For example, the probability of values smaller than $-0.50$ is
        also 0.3085.

*Explanation*: For example, the value 3.078 in the top left corner
indicates that for a $t$-distribution with 1 degree of freedom the
probability of values greater than 3.078 is 0.100. The last row shows
critical values for the standard normal distribution.

[^5]: Strictly speaking, the analysis should incorporate sampling
    weights (variable *DWEIGHT*) to adjust for different sampling
    probabilities for different types of respondents. Here the weights
    are ignored. Using them would not change the main conclusions for
    these variables.
